# **Sorting Algorithms Performance Comparison Program**

## Description
This program analyzes and compares the performance of multiple sorting algorithms using large datasets. The program measures the execution time of each algorithm on different data sizes and displays the results in a graph, allowing you to see which sorting algorithm is the most efficient based on the data size.

### Implemented Algorithms:
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Heap Sort**

The program calculates the execution time for each of these sorting algorithms and compares them visually using a graph. This way, the user can observe how each algorithm performs on datasets of different sizes and determine which one is the fastest under various conditions.

### Features:
- Allows testing on datasets of various sizes.
- Measures execution time for each sort.
- Displays the results in a comparative graph.
- Easy to use and customizable to add new sorting algorithms.
